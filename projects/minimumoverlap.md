Minimum Overlap Coverage
========================

-   **Class:** CSCI 315
-   **Grade:** A
-   **Language(s):** C++
-   **Source Code Repository:** [mtweigel/Minimum-Overlap](https://github.com/mtweigel/Minimum-Overlap)  
    (Please [email me](mailto:mtweigel@csustudent.net?subject=GitHub%20Access) to request access.)

## Project description

This project is a program that is able to efficiently find the minimum overlap of sets that cover all points. For example, if there are multiple group projects for a class that need to be presented at the end of the semester, the professor must grade every student at least once, but wants to minimize the number grades that must be performed. This project uses sets of digits to represent student IDs ranging from small to large sets of data and finds the minimum overlap of each set. It also records the time it takes to do so and saves the timing data for viewing so the the efficiency can be measured and observed.

## How to compile and run the program

```bash
$ cd Sudoku/dist
$ java -jar "Sudoku.jar"
```
