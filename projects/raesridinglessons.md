## Project description

This project was created for a fake customer named Rae who owns a horseback riding business. The website allows clients to sign up, log in, register for lessons, and view news. It also has an admin view that gives the site admin the ability to view and edit the customer list, send emails to riders, add lessons to the calendar, edit news, and add and remove trainers.

## How to host and view the website

Since this website is hosted locally, there are a number of steps required to host and view the website.

Steps:
1. Install PHP
    - Use this link: https://www.php.net/downloads.php
    - Click "Windows downloads"
    - Download the latest **x64 Thread Safe** Zip package

    - Create a new php folder
        - Wherever you want, but _save the path_ of where you save it
    - Extract the contents of the zip file to the new folder

    - In the folder, find a file named "php.ini"
    - In this file, find a section with a list of "extension="
    - If it does not already exist, add "extension=sqli"

    - Click on the Windows Start button and type "environment"
    - Click "Edit the system environment variables"
    - Go to the "Advanced" tab and click "Environment Variables"
    - Click "New" and put in the _saved path_ from before
    - Click "OK" until you're out

2. Install MySQL
    - Use this link: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/
    - Click the first download (the one with "-web-" in its subtitle)
    - Click on the .msi installer file after its downloaded
    - Follow the steps provided by the MySQL Installer to download MySQL Shell and MySQL Server (recommend using latest)
 
3. Download Github repository
    - Download the Source Code from our Release build.
    - Extract the zip file.
    
4. Launch website for viewing
    - Run the dump batch file to get all the database information.
    - Run the run.bat batch file located in the horse_site folder.
    - Paste localhost:8000 into browser and hit Enter.

## UI Design

When the website is launched, the user is greeted with the front page of the website (See Fig 1). As normal customer, the user has an option to sign up (See Fig 2). Once they have signed up or if they already have an account they may log in (See Fig 3). If the user is an admin, they have more options on the menu bar (See Fig 4) after logging in. Admins are able to view and edit the riding schedule (See Fig 5) and add lessons by specifying the trainer, class type, day, start and end time, and class level (See Fig 6). Once a lesson is created, customers are free to register for it as long as their skill level matches (See Fig 7). Admins can also view and edit the list of customers (See Fig 8), add or remove the front page news articles (See Fig 9), add and remove trainers (See Fig 10), and send out emails to all of the customers (See Fig 11).

## Additional Considerations

- Setup of this project may be troublesome, so feel free to email me if help is needed.
- Customers are unable to see their own riding level. If a lesson exists that too advanced for them, they will be unable to see or sign up for it.
