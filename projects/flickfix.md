## Project description

FlickFix is a free video editing desktop application emphasizing simplicity and ease of use. FlickFix aims to offer an intuitive and user-friendly video editing experience by streamlining the platform to include only the essential features. This approach allows even novice editors to edit videos without feeling intimidated or overwhelmed. Users can access several common features such as video trimming, intro and outro creation, and audio dubbing, all within a user-friendly GUI.

Note: This is being detected as unsafe by Windows Defender, so you will need to temporarily disable real time virus detection to install. Sketchy, I know but this happens because I have not purchased a digital certificate. 

You should be able to run FlickFix at this point. If not, please contact me with your issue.
