# CSCI 496 - Reflection Essay
### by Matthew Weigel

## Discuss one challenge you overcame during your academic development. What was the challenge, was it technical, nontechnical, or both, and how did you overcome it?

I have faced numerous challenges during my academic development at Charleston
Southern University, both technical and non-technical. One non-technical challenge 
that I am proud of overcoming was one of the required classes for my major, 
Calculus 2. In the first semester that I took the class, I struggled. Partly 
because I did not mesh well with the professor's teaching style, but also because 
I underestimated the amount of work needed to put into the class in order to succeed. 
I ended up withdrawing from the class to avoid a failing grade because I had a D in
the class and did not feel confident enough to attempt the final. This decision 
was very hard for me because up to that point I had both never failed or withdrawn 
from any of my classes before. The next semester I retook the class with a different 
professor that I ended up liking much more, and this time around I buckled down, 
put in the extra work and ended up passing with a B in the class.

## Discuss a situation where you worked with a team. How would you describe yourself 
as a teammate? Where can you improve your team skills? Be specific.

In the most recent fall semester, I worked with a team for the entirety of one of
my classes, Systems Analysis and Software Design. In this class we were tasked with
creating a website called Rae's Riding Lessons for an imaginary customer who taught
horseback riding lessons. This website had various features such as a separate view 
for customers and admins, account and lesson signups, and notifications. My job on
team was primarily as a tester, but I also ended up helping a good deal with programming 
when we needed to pick up slack.

If I had to describe myself as a teammate, I would say I am friendly and hardworking.
My teammates can always depend on me to do my work to the absolute best of my ability. 
I am also a someone who is willing to help my teammates pick up slack when needed in 
order to help the team succeed.

The place that I can most improve my team skills is in my leadership ability. I 
usually look to follow another's lead on teams that I am a part of, but I think it
is important that my team skills are well rounded and include the ability to lead others.

## What type of career in CS do you believe you are most suited for? Why this field 
and not another? Be specific.

This is a difficult question for me to answer since I am constantly learning new skills
and my CS interests keep evolving. However, based on what I have learned so far and
the types of projects I have been a part of I think the career I am most suited for is
that of a programmer where I am involved in coding. I would pick that career over one 
in another such as cybersecurity because I love writing software programs and being
able to express my creativity in ways such as solving problems and making things work 
more efficiently.

## What professional organizations would you like to join? What professional development
would you like to be a part of in the next five years? Be specific and don't consider
places of employment.

This is also a hard question for me to answer because since I am not yet actually at 
the point of choosing an organization, it is primarily a hypothetical. However, there
are a few that do pique my interest. One of which is the American Scientific Affiliation
(ASA). As a Christian myself, I am very interested in the fact that they are a Christian
based organization that focuses on the science of the universe and integrating their faith
with their research. 

The type of professional development that I would like to be apart of in the next five
years is one that is already decently destablished, simply because it would be a more 
secure work enviroment. However, alternatively, a startup could provide some interesting
opportunities for me to be involved in building a new company.

## What are the ways you can use the skills you have learned in CS to serve your 
community? Be specific.

There are several way that I could use the skills that I have learned in CS to serve
my community. For one, I could volunteer at a local non-profit orginization that needs
technical support. I could also offer to build websites or apps for outreach groups in
the community that could use them to spread their reach. Finally, I could volunteer to
help teach others in my community about computer science wherever possible, be it at
schools or other classes. I believe it is important to use the skills we have learned
not just for our own personal benefit in our careers, but also wherever they can be
used to help members of our community.
